A simple fetch api request using OpenWeather's Free API

You'll need an api key to use this so go to OpenWeather register for a free account and get your api key from this link: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Before running this, make sure you create an api_key.js and make sure you install node-fetch. An example of what api_key should look like is shown below.
```JavaScript
let api_key = "put_api_key_here";
module.exports = {api_key};
```
You can run this by typing in "node getWeather".
